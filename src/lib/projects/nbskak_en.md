# Nørrebro skakklub

Our team had the privilege to collaborate with Nørrebro Skakklub, one of Copenhagen's largest and most vibrant chess clubs. The club was founded in 2013 from the merger of two major chess clubs. Our goal for this project was to create a dynamic online presence that accurately reflects the club's rich history and active community.

We implemented a responsive calendar feature to keep members updated on upcoming events, tournaments, and club evenings. Additionally, a robust news section was developed to allow administrators to publish updates, announcements, and articles, keeping members informed. Furthermore, we designed a dedicated section to honor outstanding achievements of club members, showcasing their accomplishments and contributions.
